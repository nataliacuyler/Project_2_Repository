# Project_2_Repository
Mariel Rodriguez and Natalia Cuyler's Project 2 work space.
This project aims to give a visual insight into how many violent arrests take place throughout all 50 US states per 1,000 violent arrests. The data set chosen details these values from the year 2017. The visualizations include data graphed from states with murder arrests over 9. This graph was made using an if else statement. The second visualisation is a geom bar graph of both murder and assult arrests per 1,000 violent arrests created by using functions. 
This project is organized here, in GitHub, and all code and visualizations have been organized on one R Studio Notebook. 
In order to load our data set, locate the file in this Repository and load it through R Studio.
